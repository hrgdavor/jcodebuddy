# `plans/`

Effort-sized plans and the repository's single schedule. Read the schedule first.

| File                                                                 | What it is |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [`unified-plan.md`](unified-plan.md)                                 | **The live schedule.** Every open item in the repository, one gated step per commit, ending with the plan-cleanup phase. If you are looking for "what is left to do", this is the file. |
| [`rewrite-migration/`](rewrite-migration/README.md)                  | The **complete** JavaParser → OpenRewrite migration: the plan as it was written, the phase documents, and the verified delivery record. Historical; its README says what shipped. |
| [`enumset-overlap-jmh-plan.md`](enumset-overlap-jmh-plan.md)         | The `EEnumSet` service-overlap benchmark: mission, method matrix, parity guards, and where the evidence landed. |
| [`inject-examples-feature-port.md`](inject-examples-feature-port.md) | The port of the documentation-injection mechanism to the published `@hrg/inject-examples` CLI. Status header at the top: the port happened. |

**Conventions.** A plan states its own status in a banner at the top, with a date, and links to the record
that proves it. A plan whose work is done is kept as history or moved to [`../archive/`](../archive); a plan
whose work is open appears as steps in [`unified-plan.md`](unified-plan.md). Anything an agent *runs* lives
in `scripts/` as Bun JavaScript — never here, and never as a shell script.

**Still live as of 2026-10-09 — slimmed the same day, and 10 steps are open.** The 91 finished step records now
live in [`../archive/plans/unified-plan-2026-10.md`](../archive/plans/unified-plan-2026-10.md), so
[`unified-plan.md`](unified-plan.md) answers one question — what is left — in ~530 lines instead of ~7,000.
What remains: an ACP spike (5.3, a person), five human observations on a real editor (8.1–8.5), 3.11 (a decision
deliberately not taken), and three steps added the same day from the 6.1–6.5 refinement — **6.8** (nested,
collection and polymorphic patch application), **6.9** (the converter manifest) and **6.10** (the source →
metadata JSON pass). Those three are the remainders steps 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 left behind while being closed as
steps. The last fully-closed agent step was merge-java's review page (4.13): the block accept action, a
repo-anchored decisions file, a `serve.js` mode, and the multi-file flow with per-file counts.

Step 8.5 (Zed editor integration) was added the same day: Zed is the one editor in the suite that is neither
JetBrains nor VS Code, and the only one with a first-class agent protocol, so it gets its own survey and decision.

The plan therefore **stays here** rather than moving to [`../archive/`](../archive): step 9.6's own rule is that a schedule with open steps is a live document, applied to its own answer.
